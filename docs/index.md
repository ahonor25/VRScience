## Welcome to VRScience

VRScience is an ongoing project displaying how the world can make bioplastics, and use sustainable buildings to make the world climate change free. 

### Version History - Oculus Quest

VRScience has had multiple versions, but each version is archived for easy access. If you have an Oculus Quest 1 or 2, you can sideload it to your device (instructions at the end). Only some versions have been archived, and some are not working, so if you are interested in finding a new, working version, use the latest version.

### How did we make it?

We used [Unity](https://unity.com/) and the [C# programming language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) with [Virtual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) to write and build our game. To make the models used in the game, Jake used [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and I used [3ds Max 2022](https://www.autodesk.com/products/3ds-max/overview?term=1-YEAR&support=null). The code is freely avalible on the GitHub page (see the button on the top right) where you can see how we put together our code. If you are interested in remixing our project, you can create a pull request on out GitHub page (see the button at the top right). This will allow you to make a copy of our code, and edit it with the software we used.

### Interested in making a game?

You will need to have the software we used, which can be found easily by googling the tools we used. You should install Unity, Blender, and Virtual Studio. A YouTube channel that may be helpful has been linked below, and will teach you everything you need to know about getting started.

### Want to help make the game, and add future improvements?

This game is licenced under the MIT licence meaning you are free to add improvements. Remember to read the licence file which can be found on the GitHub source page (see button in top right). This shows you what rights you have since we don't want to have our hard work sold by someone else! In short, you can remix the game 

### How to play our game

<h4>Oculus Quest 1 & 2 Users</h4>

You will need special software called SideQuest to install our game. You can find the software freely avalable to the public [here](https://sidequestvr.com/setup-howto). Make sure to follow the directions on that page, and then come back here to finish. After you are done, you want to find the icon that looks like a box with an arrow. You can find a screenshot of it [here](https://tinyimg.io/i/iNkp17V.png) to help. Make sure your headset is connected to your computer, and a green dot appears in the top right, and it says connected. After you click the box with an arrow, find the file named ```VR Science Alpha Version (version number)```, select it, then wait until SideQuest says it's done, this shouldn't take very long. After you did that, put on your headset, and find the app/game icon in VR which should look like a bunch of boxes. A window should appear, and in the top right of the window, find a dropdown. Scroll down with your controller, and select "Unknown Sources". Then, find VRScience or BioplasticsVR (depends on what version you have, newer ones should be called VRScience). After finding it, click on it, and wait for the game to load. Yay, now you can play VRScience, the controls are very easy, and shouldn't be to hard to find.

<h4>Oculus Rift & Rift S Users</h4>

For Oculus Rift and Rift S headsets, you can use the EXE file provided below. After downloading the file, open it, and agree to the licence agreement, and install it where you would like it installed, the exisitng location is recommended. After you do that, hit the install button. Now, on your desktop, you should see a city icon with the name of "VRScience". Before opening it, make sure to setup your headset within the Oculus software, and connect the controllers. After you do that, you can start up the game, just double click on the icon. Once you get into the game, you should see a very stretched out image of the city icon. Don't worry, this is normal, and all you need to do is wait a couple seconds. This image checks the display is functioning and isn't bad. After you have loaded into the game, you can freely explore. Enjoy the game!

<h4><b>EXPERIMENTAL:</b> AndroidVR</h4>

If you have an Android phone, you may be able to use VRScience with your phone. This method should be only used by people who already have the things needed to run VR apps. If you already have a Cardboard headset or other type of VR headset, and 1 or 2 VR controllers, you can continue. Note that support with the headset is not avalible yet, that is coming soon. If you don't, please don't buy these things just to try out the game, you can use the YouTube video above to see the game. We will soon be updating it to a 360 degree video so you can see it in VR without a controller or even a headset. If you have the things above, you can continute. Remember, this is still in development, and may not work for all headsets and controllers. Install the Oculus Quest version onto your phone by visiting this page on your phone and clicking on the .apk file downloaded. [If you need more help doing this step, click here to get a guide](https://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/60953/install-apk-files-android/) Now that you installed it, you can open it on your phone. Make sure that your controllers are connected to your phone, then you can move around. Note that putting it in the headset will be very disorienting as the game doesn't have Cardboard support. This page will update as more features become available. 

<h4>NOTE FOR iOS & NON-ANDROIDVR USERS<h4>
  
ScienceVR does <b>NOT</b> work on phones without VR headsets or iPad/iPhone/iPod users. Please don't try to install them on those devices, Android will install the app but you won't be able to move. Note that is the intention of the game, to use VR controllers, not to move around with your fingers. iOS devices will not install the game since it is not made for iOS devices. The file will not open, and isn't native to iOS devices.
