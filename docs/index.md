## Welcome to VRScience

VRScience is an ongoing project displaying how the world can make bioplastics, and use sustainable buildings to make the world climate change free. 

### Version History

VRScience has had multiple versions, but each version is archived for easy access. If you have an Oculus Quest 1 or 2, you can sideload it to your device (instructions at the end). Only some versions have been archived, and some are not working, so if you are interested in finding a new, working version, use the latest version.

### How did we make it?

We used [Unity](https://unity.com/) and the [C# programming language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) with [Virtual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) to write and build our game. To make the models used in the game, Jake used [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and I used [3ds Max 2022](https://www.autodesk.com/products/3ds-max/overview?term=1-YEAR&support=null). The code is freely avalible on the GitHub page (see the button on the top right) where you can see how we put together our code. If you are interested in remixing our project, you can create a pull request on out GitHub page (see the button at the top right). This will allow you to make a copy of our code, and edit it with the software we used.

### Interested in making a game?

You will need to have the software we used, which can be found easily by googling the tools we used. You should install Unity, Blender, and Virtual Studio. A YouTube channel that may be helpful has been linked below, and will teach you everything you need to know about getting started.

### How to play our game

<h5>Oculus Quest 1 & 2 Users</h5>

You will need special software called SideQuest to install our game. You can find the software freely avalable to the public [here](https://sidequestvr.com/setup-howto). Make sure to follow the directions on that page, and then come back here to finish. After you are done, you want to find the icon that looks like a box with an arrow. You can find a screenshot of it [here](https://tinyimg.io/i/iNkp17V.png) to help. Make sure your headset is connected to your computer, and a green dot appears in the top right, and it says connected. After you click the box with an arrow, find the file named ```VR Science Alpha Version (version number)```, select it, then wait until SideQuest says it's done, this shouldn't take very long. After you did that, put on your headset, and find the app/game icon in VR which should look like a bunch of boxes. A window should appear, and in the top right of the window, find a dropdown. Scroll down with your controller, and select "Unknown Sources". Then, find VRScience or BioplasticsVR (depends on what version you have, newer ones should be called VRScience). After finding it, click on it, and wait for the game to load. Yay, now you can play VRScience, the controls are very easy, and shouldn't be to hard to find.

<h5>Oculus Rift & Rift S Users</h5>

For this, you will need not need to use Unity or SideQuest. The links below are for the latest version of the game only. After clicking on the link, an .exe file will appear in your downloads folder. All you need to do is launch the Oculus software like all games, connect your headset, and set it up within the Oculus software. After doing that, double click on the .exe file, and a window will appear. Put on your headset, and you will be done and ready to play! The controls are very easy, and shouldn't be to hard to find.
