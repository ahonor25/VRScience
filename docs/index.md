## Welcome to VRScience

VRScience is an ongoing project displaying how the world can make bioplastics, and use sustainable buildings to make the world climate change free. 

### Version History

VRScience has had multiple versions, but each version is archived for easy access. If you have an Oculus Quest 1 or 2, you can sideload it to your device (instructions at the end). Only some versions have been archived, and some are not working, so if you are interested in finding a new, working version, use the latest version.
